1. Install requirements

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

2. Place your .pgn from Lichess within the ```/games``` folder then run the following command line:

```python main.py {name_of_your_file}```

For example:
```python main.py cool_game```

This will create a ```{name_of_your_file}_cleaned.pgn``` file within the ```games``` folder that can directly be imported into Chessbase
