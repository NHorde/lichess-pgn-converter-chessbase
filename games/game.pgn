1. e4 { [%eval 0.36] } 1... e5 { [%eval 0.35] } 2. Nf3 { [%eval 0.29] } 2... Nc6 { [%eval 0.32] } 3. d4 { [%eval 0.13] } 3... exd4 { [%eval 0.13] } 4. Bc4 { [%eval 0.0] } 4...

Bxc6+?! { [%eval -0.98] } { Never saw that move before and it's actually an inaccuracy } (7. Nxd4 { The correct move order }) 7... bxc6 { [%eval -0.75] } 8. Nxd4 { [%eval -0.81] } 8... Bc5!? { [%eval -0.68] } { I was debating between Bc5, c5 or Ba6. I decided for that move because worse case scenario I just transpose into a position I've had before in the TNM. It's actually SF 2nd choice but only if Black finds the correct continuation (which I did not) } (8... Ba6 { My initial intuition because White loses kingside castling right. Not sure what I chickened out }) 9. Be3 { [%eval -0.64] } 9... Bd7?! { [%eval 0.38] } { Too early/comital as the bishop would be more active on a6 } (9... Bb6) 10. O-O { [%eval -0.05] } 10... O-O { [%eval 0.25] } 11. Nd2 { [%eval 0.02] } (11. f3 Ng5 12. f4 Ne4 13. Nd2 Nxd2 14. Qxd2 Bb6 15. c3 { The exact same position with the addition of f4. A position that happened in a previous TNM vs young Gu. }) 11... Nxd2 { [%eval 0.34] } 12. Qxd2 { [%eval 0.04] } 12... Bb6 { [%eval 0.24] } 13. c3 { [%eval -0.35] } { And we've transposed into a position I've had a couple of TNM before with the omission of f4 for White so I am up a tempo. So I knew I had a good position } 13... f6! { [%eval 0.34] } (13... Re8! { More precise to avoid trading pieces } 14. f4 f6) 14. e6 { [%eval 0.21] } 14... c5! { [%eval 0.32] } { I knew it was a key move because I deeply analyzed my loss against T. Gu. } 15. exd7 { [%eval 0.37] } 15... cxd4 { [%eval 0.22] } 16. cxd4?! { [%eval 0.01] } { I think my opponent wanted to keep pieces. SF does not dislike taking with the pawn but I think it's not a good practical choice. Black's DSB is much more active than White's who is tied to the defense of the d4 pawn. On top of it I don't see a way for White to make progress as they need their DSB to release protection of d4 in order to target the a and c pawns. Hence I concluded Black has the initiative now } 16... Qxd7 { [%eval 0.01] } 17. a4 { [%eval 0.02] } 17... a5 { [%eval 0.13] } 18. Rac1? { [%eval -1.23] } { Just dropping a pawn } (18.

Rd1 { [%eval -2.2] } 21... Rb8!? { [%eval -1.26] } (21... Rae8 22. Rcc1 h5 { SF recommendation. White is paralyzed so the idea is just to grab as much space as possible. This looks too complicated for me }) 22. b3? { [%eval -2.74] } { I think they were trying to open the b file to generate some counter play. White's problem is that they have no active plan otherwise } 22... Qxb3 { [%eval -2.62] } 23. Rb2 { [%eval -2.73] } 23... Qa4 { [%eval -2.79] } 24. Rdb1 { [%eval -3.24] } 24... Ree8 { [%eval -2.93] } { The initial plan was to load against the d4 pawn but now Black is just up two clear pawns so there's no need to complicate the position. The idea is to keep the d4 pawn for White as it paralyzes their bishop, double everything on the a file and push the a pawn } 25. Rb5 { [%eval -2.88] } { Targeting d5 but they missed that Black can force exchanges now } 25... Ba7! { [%eval -3.14] } { There's no intermediate shenanigan against the a5 pawn because of back rank mate issues } 26. Qd3 { [%eval -5.85] } (26. Qxa5?? Qxa5 { Back rank mate issues }) (26. Rxa5?? Rxb1+ 27. Qc1 Rxc1+ 28. Bxc1 Re1#) 26... Rxb5 { [%eval -6.0] } 27. Qxb5 { [%eval -7.61] } (27. Rxb5 { More resilient to keep pieces OTB } 27... Bxd4) 27... Qxb5 { [%eval -7.38] } 28. Rxb5 { [%eval -7.9] } 28... Rb8! { [%eval -7.52] } { I think they missed that move when playing Qxb5. They are targeting a4 and c7 but Black has a nice way to save them both due to back rank mate } 29. Rxb8+ { [%eval -7.76] } 29... Bxb8 { [%eval -7.19] } { Forcing a very easy endgame with 2 extra pawns with 1 passer } 30. Bd2 { [%eval -8.06] } 30... a4 { [%eval -8.3] } 31. Kf1 { [%eval -8.5] } 31... Ba7 { [%eval -8.47] } 32.
